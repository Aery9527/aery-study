# version-feature

study all java version featiures.

- **incubator** : features are not mature yet but allow early adopters and enthusiasts to use them in experiments.
  You can expect them to be buggy or unstable as they need to further mature in the next releases.
  But they can even be removed again, based on the feedback and the evolution of their development.
- **preview** : features have been fully specified, developed, and implemented, 
  but are still being evaluated and can further change.
  They can be used in development to experiment with upcoming new features and can be expected to become available in a future version, 
  although this is still not guaranteed.
